# ðŸŽ® Study Stride

Study Stride is a web program designed to help students keep track of their wellbeing while working on assignments. 

It is easy to forget to keep yourself healthy when under the stress of assignments. 

Study Strive aims to provide a gamified visual indicator to help students identify when they should rehydrate, eat or rest.

By gamifying self-care, StudyStride makes wellbeing fun and rewarding!
