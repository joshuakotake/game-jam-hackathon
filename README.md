# 👾 StudyStride 🕹️

StudyStride is an 8-bit inspired web program designed to help students keep track of their wellbeing while working on assignments. 

Many students forget to keep themselves healthy and neglect basic needs when under the stress of assignments.

Study Stride aims to provide a simple yet fun visual indicator to help students identify when they should rehydrate, eat or rest while studying.

By gamifying self-care, StudyStride makes wellbeing fun and rewarding!
