# Study Stride

🏆**People's Choice Award Winner for UNSW DevSoc's 2025 Game Jam Hackathon**🏆

Study Stride is a web program designed to help students keep track of their wellbeing while working on assignments. 

Many students forget to keep themselves healthy and neglect basic needs when under the stress of assignments.

Study Stride aims to provide a simple yet fun visual indicator to help students identify when they should rehydrate, eat or rest while studying.

By gamifying self-care, StudyStride makes wellbeing fun and rewarding!

# How it works:

* Task Tracking:
  * Users input their assignment due date, which powers a progress bar showing remaining time.
* Wellbeing Metrics:
  * Three vital stats (Energy, Thirst, and Hunger) gradually deplete over time.
* Health System:
  * Health points are lost when any stat enters the red zone (1 point per depleted stat)
  * Multiple depleted stats stack their penalties (up to 3 health points lost simultaneously)
  * Stats can be replenished by taking breaks (pauses the game during recovery)
* Scoring:
  * Final wellbeing score (S-F rank) based on total health lost
  * Losing all but 1 health point results in task failure, losing 9+ health points automatically fails the wellbeing assessment
  * Successful time management rewards a "Task Complete" screen.
